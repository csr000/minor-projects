The Plan Of Guess Game.py
---------------------------

guess_number = (0->20)
guess_no = 5

Initial Stage
------------>
user enters guess, if its correct, print congrats else try again

Stage 2
------>
give them 3 tries, if non of the 3 tries match, print 'sorry, u couldnt guess, game over'


Advanced Stage
-------------->
1. if number input is ova 3 number distant, print "number is too high" and vice versa
2. if number is 3||2 distant, print "You're near to guess the right number" and vice versa













Future Plans
----------->
Play with the user's mind, make the user think for a sec that, he/she is an idiot!
//The plan for it is printing the output based on rand.int.
  Eg: if rand.int=1, instead of very near, print "number is too high" and vice versa.
      same for the rest
      After taking the 3rd guess, print "At least Someone has tell u to not trust anyone right,
      guess what, I fooled u with the hints and you've already loss 3 guesses? 
      Think You're Smart? let's see how you're going to make it from here. Do what the Champions do!
      else, you're certified dumb!"
      After taking the 4th guess, print "Well last Chance left, Prove me wrong!"
      After taking the last guess, print "You lost!, the secret number is"
